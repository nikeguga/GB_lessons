# Markdown sintaxis instruction

## Text input

To make bold use two damn stars from both sides like **THIS** 

Or two underscores from sides as a nerdy way to be bold

To make italics one starfrom both sides will do, *see*?

Or you can be a nerd and use underscore for what I care, one for each side, and go get some MTG cards and new glasses (with respect though)

So you can make a mutant from those two. You gotta get underscores from both sides and inside them gotta get some double stars. You'll get this bad boy:

_**BAD BOY**_
