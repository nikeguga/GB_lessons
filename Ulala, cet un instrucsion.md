# Markdown sintaxis instruction

## Text input

To make bold use two damn stars from both sides like **THIS** 

Or two underscores from sides as a nerdy way to be bold

To make italics one starfrom both sides will do, *see*?

Or you can be a nerd and use underscore for what I care, one for each side, and go get some MTG cards and new glasses (with respect though)

So you can make a mutant from those two. You gotta get underscores from both sides and inside them gotta get some double stars. You'll get this bad boy:

_**BAD BOY**_

## Lists

so we talk no numbers. We go with a star

* see, you bum?
* you see, bum?
* Hobbo, see you!

And now we talk numbers, mf. You gotta put a number in, then put a damn point.

1. you dig me?
2. you dig me, bro?
3. Have you ever been digging me, bro? 

## Images

You put ![some text](image name) and here you go

like this:

![300 bucks](gaci.jpg)

## Links

So you wanna get some links in your crappy "content"? Easy! You can get damn link in <>
Like this: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ>, understiood? Also you may do some other staff. If you need to put discription, you get text in [ ] then you go with link in ( ). And your text becomes that same link. And if you are a dumbass, here is an expample [Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

## Tables

Now we are getting to the sweet spot. This MD can do some tables, but you gonna hate it. you use | (this is vertical slash, or pipe, or you IQ if you're in for roman numbers) for column separation. Then you use - (meaning minus, like what you see on your bank account) for horizontal lines to separate only the heads of the table.
