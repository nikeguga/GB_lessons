# Markdown sintaxis instruction

## Text input

To make bold use two damn stars from both sides like **THIS** 

Or two underscores from sides as a nerdy way to be bold

To make italics one star from both sides will do, *see*?

Or you can be a nerd and use underscore for what I care, one for each side, and go get some MTG cards and new glasses (with respect though)

So you can make a mutant from those two. You gotta get underscores from both sides and inside them gotta get some double stars. You'll get this bad boy:

_**BAD BOY**_

And when you have an itching need to emphasise your oh so very important opinion or whatever and you have to cross out the text you were working on so hard you go with ~ on both sides, and double them. ~~I like you~~

## Lists

so we talk no numbers. We go with a star

* see, you bum?
* you see, bum?
* Hobbo, see you!

And now we talk numbers, mf. You gotta put a number in, then put a damn point.

1. you dig me?
2. you dig me, bro?
3. Have you ever been digging me, bro? 

## Images

You put ![some text](image name) and here you go

like this:

![300 bucks](gaci.jpg)

## Links

So you wanna get some links in your crappy "content"? Easy! You can get damn link in <>
Like this: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ>, understiood? Also you may do some other staff. If you need to put discription, you get text in [ ] then you go with link in ( ). And your text becomes that same link. And if you are a dumbass, here is an expample [Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

## Tables

Now we are getting to the sweet spot. This MD can do some tables, but you gonna hate it. you use | (this is vertical slash, or pipe, or you IQ if you're in for roman numbers) for column separation. Then you use - (meaning minus, like what you see on your bank account) for horizontal lines to separate only the heads of the table. 

| Name |  IQ  |
|------|------|
| You  | none |
| Me   | 9000 |

Oh I hate it, better use damn generators

## Quotes

And the last one, quotes. You can get a quote with > symbol, but you'll heve to do it in the new line. Also if you are quoting dudes that like to qoute you can do it up to 15 times, then even MD thinks that this is some BS, you creep.
